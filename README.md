<p align="center" >This project is a virtual store for a hamburger shop, in this case without a server. We have an area with categories where the user is directed to the category he wants just by clicking on one of the carousel options, once the user chooses the item he is directed to the cart where he can add more units of the same item or complete the purchase.</p>
